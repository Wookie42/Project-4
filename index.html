					<h3>My Adventure in coding, so far.</h3>
					<p>
						I started learning code last month, April 5th, 2023, and I feel like I have learned a lot about coding things like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">CSS</a> aren't nearly as scary as they once were, and I can't wait to continue my journey through <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/">correlation-one</a> Soon I can call myself a novice coder, which is an exciting thought, I'm looking forward to reaching my destination, but until then, I'll keep going., I will keep pushing forward, aiming for the top. Although I haven't had any significant achievements in life, I am still young and have so much room to grow and do great things
